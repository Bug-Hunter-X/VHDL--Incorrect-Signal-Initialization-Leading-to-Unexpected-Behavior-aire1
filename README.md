# VHDL: Incorrect Signal Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in VHDL code: incorrect initialization of internal signals.  Improperly initialized signals can lead to unpredictable behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains code with the flawed initialization. The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides a corrected version.

**Bug:** The `internal_data` signal is initialized to "x"00", which is an uninitialized state in VHDL representing an unknown value.  This can result in unexpected behavior during simulation or synthesis.

**Solution:** The solution initializes `internal_data` to a known, valid value (e.g., "00000000").
